# CTF walkthoughts
After having studied most of [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)â€™s learning paths, I decided to focus on putting what I have been learning to practice and try my hand on its Capture The Flag challenges.

Having said that, take what I write with a grain (or many grains) of salt, as I am completely new to all these concepts and tools, and I will be writing walkthroughs mostly to learn and solidify what I (think that) already know.

Hopefully, aside from my own learning, people who are complete beginners, like myself, might find these posts helpful. 

Feel free to learn more [about me](https://cspanias.github.io/aboutme/) and contact me if you have questions.
