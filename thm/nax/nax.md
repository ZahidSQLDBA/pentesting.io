This is the second, after [Dogcat](https://github.com/CSpanias/pentesting.io/blob/main/thm/dogcat/dogcat.md), **medium rated difficulty** room of the Starter Series. 

This felt like a treasure hunt room, in a sense that it did not require much usual pentest tooling usage, but mostly for searching constantly one clue after another. Having said that, I did enjoy working on this room, as I learned a lot of new stuff such as **Nagios XI**, **the periodic table** (yes, chemistry!) and the **Piet programming language** (you haven't heard it before either, have you?).

Reading the room's description:

>_Identify the critical **security flaw in the most powerful and trusted network monitoring software on the market**, that allows an user authenticated execute **remote code execution**._

and pairing that with the room's note saying that it requires _Metasploit 6_, we can safely assume that we will need to **find a Nagios XI exploit on Metasploit that allows us to perform RCE**. 

That's sound like an easy thing to do, but believe me when I say that it's not!
