# Tomghost Walkthrough (2023)
## Detailed walkthough for TryHackMe's tomghost CTF

Tomghost room's description.Tomghost's CTF room has the goal to "identify recent vulnerabilities to try exploit the system or read files that you should not have access to". Let's first start with gaining an understanding what we are actually trying to do on this room.
Background Information
As a beginner, I was using the terms Apache and Apache Tomcat interchangeably, but they are not really the same thing. You can read more about their differences on this short GeeksForGeeks article, but here is the main gist:
Apache web server is designed to create the web-servers and it can host one or more HTTP based web-servers, while Apache Tomcat is a web container that allows the users to run Servlet and JAVA Server Pages that are based on the web-applications and it can also be used as the HTTP server. 
This room is focused on a vulnerability found in the Tomcat container:
Room's Ghostcat banner.The Ghostcat vulnerability does essentially what the room's description says: if the Apache Jserv Protocol (AJP) is exposed over the internet (usually on port 8009), it allows an attacker to read sensitive files from the Tomcat directories.
Based on the above information, we kind of know what we should expect:
Find the AJP protocol exposed on port 8009.
Find an existing exploit to leverage, gain non-privileged access and snath our first 🚩.
Find a way to escalate our privileges to root and snatch our second 🚩.

CTF Process
As usual, let's start enumerating our target with a port-scanning using nmap:

nmap <target-ip> -sV -T4 -oA nmap-scan -open
<target-ip> The target machine's IP.
-sV Attempts to determine the version of the service running on port.
-T4 Aggressive (4) speeds scans; assumes you are on a reasonably fast and reliable network.
-oA <file-name> Output in the three major formats at once.
-open Show only open (or possibly open) ports.

As expected, the results include port 8009 using the AJP protocol:
Port-scanning results.2. Searching Exploit-db for an existing vulnerability related to "apache tomcat ajp", we find CVE-2020–1938, which conveniently let us know that it's included in Metasploit:
CVE-2020–19383. Launching Metasploit (using the  msfconsole command) and searching for CVE-2020–1938, confirms that there is an existing module which we can directly use as follows:
The CVE-2020–1938 exploit on Metasploit.As we can see using by using the options command, everything but RHOSTS is already good to go. We can pass our target's IP to RHOSTS by typing set RHOSTS <target-ip>. We can then use the check command to find out if our target is vulnerable, and then just run the exploit:
Running the exploit.By exploiting the Ghostcast vulnerability we are expecting to find and read sensitive files in the Tomcat directories. The exploit managed to do that successfully, providing us with a pair of credentials to use 👏.
4. Remember that the nmap results from step 1, included an SSH server on port 22:
The SSH server from our nmap scan.We can try connecting to this SSH server using the obtained credentials:
Connecting to the SSH server.Success 🎉! We have now gained an initial foothold with a low-privileged user, as planned, and we should be able to find and (maybe) read our first 🚩. 
We know that we are searching for a file called user.txt, so let's just search for that:
Capturing our first flag!The find command works as follows:
/ Start searching from the root directory.
-iname user.txt Search, ignoring casing, for a file called user.txt.
-type f Search only for files.
2>/dev/null Suppress any errors.

5. The only thing left is to find the root.txt file which, as the name suggests, would require escalating our privileges to a root account. 
When listing the files in our current user's home directory, two files appear: credential.pgp and tryhackme.asc. 
Files found in the current user's home directory.GPG is a popular Linux security tool for encrypting files. You can find more about GPG on this amazing article from RedHat. 
For now, all we need to know is the following:
credential.pgp is a binary GPG encryted file which, based on its name, contains the root credentials we are searching for!
tryhackme.asc contains a hashed password which might be needed for decrypting the above file.

We can transfer these files to our local machine using the scp command and try to first decrypt the file:
Transferring the files locally and attemp to decrypt the GPG file.As we can see, the GPG file is encrypted with a secret key. When we are trying to import tryhackme.asc as a key to GPG, we are asked to provide a passphrase:
GPG failed key import.So, let's use John The Ripper for cracking that hash, and then provide it as passphrase when asked.
We first need to convert the hash file into a suitable format for john using gpg2john, and then pass that file to john:
Cracking hashes with John!Now, we can use this passphrase when importing tryhackme.asc as a key to GPG, as well as when we are asked for it again, while decrypting the credentials.gpg file:
Import a key and decrypting a GPG-encrypted file.6. We have now obtained the credentials of another low-privileged user, what is called horizontal privilege escalation. 
Let's switch to that user and find out if there is anything that we can leverage that will allows us to gain a privileged account, that is, perform vertical privilege escalation.
By checking if there is any program that the user merlin could run as sudo, we find out that the zip program is on that list:
Checking for programs that our current user can use with sudo.Visiting the GTFOBins site and searching for zip we can find some interesting information:
GTFOBins page for zip.By just following the instructions, we can get ourselves a root shell and capture our final 🚩:
Capturing our final flag 🥂!
